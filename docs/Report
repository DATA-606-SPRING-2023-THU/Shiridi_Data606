## Introduction:

Cancer is a condition when cells proliferate uncontrollably. A woman's chance of dying from breast cancer is 1 in 39, or roughly 2.5%. In the United States, about 42,000 women die from breast cancer each year, out of the 264,000 who are diagnosed. One of the most prevalent malignancies in women worldwide is breast cancer. According to estimates, 30% of newly diagnosed malignancies in women in the United States in 2020 will be breast cancer. A higher survival percentage and more effective treatment choices are both possible with early identification of breast cancer. We will talk about different machine learning models and how well they perform when determining if a tumor is benign or malignant in this session.

## Aim:

93% of women with breast cancer who are diagnosed early will survive for the first five years. Mammogram screening is used to find the tumor, but it is not completely accurate. These statistics suggest using machine learning to diagnose breast cancer as the conventional method is not very reliable. 

Our goal in this project is to examine the widely available Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset and assess how well various machine learning models perform at identifying tumor malignancy. We can evaluate how well these models perform at correctly classifying tumors as benign or malignant by studying the dataset and using a variety of classification algorithms. This data can help medical personnel make educated decisions about patient care and lead to the creation of more precise diagnostic tools.
