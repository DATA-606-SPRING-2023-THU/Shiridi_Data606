# Title:Detection of breast cancer

## Introduction:

Cancer is a condition when cells proliferate uncontrollably. A woman's chance of dying from breast cancer is 1 in 39, or roughly 2.5%. In the United States, about 42,000 women die from breast cancer each year, out of the 264,000 who are diagnosed. One of the most prevalent malignancies in women worldwide is breast cancer. According to estimates, 30% of newly diagnosed malignancies in women in the United States in 2020 will be breast cancer. A higher survival percentage and more effective treatment choices are both possible with early identification of breast cancer. We will talk about different machine learning models and how well they perform when determining if a tumor is benign or malignant in this session.

## Machine Learning models used

Logistic Regression

KNN

Light BGM

Gradient Boosting

Random Forest Classifier

## Conclusion

Through this effort, we hope to shed light on the performance traits of several machine learning models for categorizing breast cancer. To identify the advantages and disadvantages of each model, we will evaluate each one's accuracy, precision, recall, and other evaluation criteria. We'll also contrast our findings with those of earlier research and look into how these models might be used in actual-world scenarios. By correctly identifying breast cancers as benign or malignant, we can help medical professionals make defensible choices about additional diagnostic procedures, therapeutic strategies, and patient care. The ultimate goal is to increase the precision and effectiveness of breast cancer diagnosis, which will improve patient outcomes and maybe save lives.
